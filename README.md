brinkbit-style-es6
==================

A linting module to enforce Brinkbit's es6 javascript style.
The style is based on Airbnb's es6 javascript style and is outlined [here](https://github.com/Brinkbit/javascript).

Getting Started
===============

Adding the brinkbit es6 style enforcement to your project is as easy as

`$ npm install --save-dev brinkbit-style-es6`

That's all you should need!

If you use the atom text editor, I highly recommend using the [linter](https://atom.io/packages/linter) and [linter-eslint](https://atom.io/packages/linter-eslint) packages. These will highlight linting errors for you in your text editor right out of the box.
